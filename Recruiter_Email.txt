Subject: Autonomous DevOps Dashboard — Founder Showcase

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I wanted to share my latest engineering milestone — a fully automated, self-healing DevOps dashboard built for real-time monitoring, recruiter-grade storytelling, and public broadcast.

?? Panic macros for instant recovery  
?? Live metrics synced with GA telemetry  
??? Watchdog tab with self-healing triggers  
?? Zipped audit trail + narration overlays  
?? Visual storytelling blocks across all tabs  

You can preview the dashboard and download the zipped showcase here:

Every tab is telemetry-enabled, milestone-locked, and demo-polished. I’d love to connect and explore opportunities where this kind of engineering impact can shine.

Best,  
Varun Paruchuri  
Founder, ai-devops-dashboard
